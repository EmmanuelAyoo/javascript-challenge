# Javascript-Challenge

Write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset we provide. We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. Only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.
